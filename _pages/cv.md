Research Projects
======
* Principal Investigator
Detail morphology classification by deep learning (ongoing)
In order to present the future CSST, Euclid, and other large survey telescope, I explore the deep learning method for classifying detailed morphology of DESI Legacy Imaging Survey Bright Galaxy Sample.

* Co-investigator
  * Missing Data Imputation via GAN
We present a model based on GAN to impute missing data in astronomical tabulate data.

  * From Images to Features: Unbiased Morphology Classification via VAE and DA
We present a VAE and domain adaptation (DA), which can be applied to dimensionality reduction, defect image identification, and morphology classification in large optical surveys.
