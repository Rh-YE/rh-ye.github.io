Context. Around the year 2000, Triton’s south pole experienced an extreme summer solstice that occurs every ∼650 years, when the subsolar
latitude reached about 50◦S. Bracketing this epoch, a few occultations probed Triton’s atmosphere in 1989, 1995, 1997, 2008 and 2017. A recent
ground-based stellar occultation observed on 6 October 2022 provides a new measurement of Triton’s atmospheric pressure which is presented
here.

Aims. The goal is to constrain the Volatile Transport Models (VTMs) of Triton’s atmosphere that is basically in vapor pressure equilibrium with
the nitrogen ice at its surface.
Methods. Fits to the occultation light curves yield Triton’s atmospheric pressure at the reference radius 1400 km, from which the surface pressure
is induced.

Results. The fits provide a pressure p1400 = 1.211 ± 0.044 μbar at radius1400 km (47-km altitude), from which a surface pressure of psurf =
14.54 ± 0.53 μbar is induced (1σ error bars). To within error bars, this is identical to the pressure derived from the previous occultation of 5
October 2017, p1400 = 1.18 ± 0.03 μbar and psurf = 14.1 ± 0.4 μbar, respectively. Based on recent models of Triton’s volatile cycles, the overall
evolution over the last 30 years of the surface pressure is consistent with N2 condensation taking place in the northern hemisphere. However,
models typically predict a steady decrease in surface pressure for the period 2005-2060, which is not confirmed by this observation. Complex
surface-atmosphere interactions, such as ice albedo runaway and formation of local N2 frosts in the equatorial regions of Triton could explain the
relatively constant pressure between 2017 and 2022
