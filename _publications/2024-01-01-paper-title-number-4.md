excerpt: 'The morphological classification of galaxies plays a important role in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.
We present a catalog of detailed morphology classification in the DESI BASS+MzLS footprint of 214,600 galaxies (with
ùëß < 0.15 and ùëöùëü < 17.77). Leveraging a Bayesian CNN initially trained on Galaxy Zoo DECaLS labels, we successfully
adapted our model for the BASS+MzLS footprint through source-free unsupervised domain adaptation without collecting
new labels. This domain adaptation addresses the covariate shift between the DECaLS and BASS, MzLS datasets due to the
different survey parameters. Our model can predict the posterior of each question-answer pair in the GZD-5 decision tree that
is related to morphology. Benchmarking against previous methodologies, our approach demonstrates superior performance,
particularly in effectively handling domain adaptation verified through the overlapping footprints of DECaLS and BASS+MzLS.
Our code, along with the detailed morphological classifications for a total of 214,600 galaxies, is publicly accessible.'
